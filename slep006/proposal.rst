================================
Routing sample-aligned meta-data 
================================

Scikit-learn has limited support for information pertaining to each sample
(henceforth "sample properties") to be passed through an estimation pipeline.
The user can, for instance, pass fit parameters to all members of a
FeatureUnion, or to a specified member of a Pipeline using dunder (``__``)
prefixing::

    >>> from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    >>> pipe = Pipeline([('clf', LogisticRegression())])
    >>> pipe.fit([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [5, 6],
    ...          clf__sample_weight=[.5, .7])  # doctest: +SKIP

Several other meta-estimators, such as GridSearchCV, support forwarding these
fit parameters to their base estimator when fitting.

Desirable features we do not currently support include:

* passing sample properties (e.g. `sample_weight`) to a scorer used in
  cross-validation
* passing sample properties (e.g. `groups`) to a CV splitter in nested cross
  validation
* (maybe in scope) passing sample properties (e.g. `sample_weight`) to some
  scorers and not others in a multi-metric cross-validation setup
* (likley out of scope) passing sample properties to non-fit methods, for
  instance to index grouped samples that are to be treated as a single sequence
  in prediction.

Definitions
-----------

consumer
    An estimator, scorer, splitter, etc., that receives and can make use of
    one or more passed props.
key
    A label passed along with sample prop data to indicate how it should be
    interpreted (e.g. "weight").
router
    An estimator or function that passes props on to some other router or
    consumer, potentially selecting which props to pass to which destination,
    and by what key.

Desiderata
----------

We will consider the following attributes to develop and compare solutions:

Usability
   Can the use cases be achieved in succinct, readable code? Can common use
   cases be achieved with a simple recipe copy-pasted from a QA forum?
Brittleness
   If a property is being routed through a Pipeline, does changing the
   structure of the pipeline (e.g. adding a layer of nesting) require rewriting
   other code?
Error handling
   If the user mistypes the name of a sample property, will an appropriate
   exception be raised?
Impact on meta-estimator design
   How much meta-estimator code needs to change? How hard will it be to
   maintain?
Impact on estimator design
   How much will the proposal affect estimator developers?
Backwards compatibility
   Can existing behavior be maintained?
Forwards compatibility
   Is the solution going to make users' code more
   brittle with future changes? (For example, will a user's pipeline change
   behaviour radically when sample_weight is implemented on some estimator)
Introspection
   If sensible to do so (e.g. for improved efficiency), can a
   meta-estimator identify whether its base estimator (recursively) would
   handle some particular sample property (e.g. so a meta-estimator can choose
   between weighting and resampling)?

Keyword arguments vs. a single argument
---------------------------------------

Currently, sample properties are provided as keyword arguments to a `fit`
method. In redeveloping sample properties, we can instead accept a single
parameter (named `props` or `sample_props` or `etc`, for example) which maps
string keys to arrays of the same length (a "DataFrame-like").

Keyword arguments::

    >>> gs.fit(X, y, groups=groups, sample_weight=sample_weight)

Single argument::

    >>> gs.fit(X, y, prop={'groups': groups, 'weight': weight})

While drafting this document, we will assume the latter notation for clarity.

Advantages of multiple keyword arguments:

* succinct
* possible to maintain backwards compatible support for sample_weight, etc.
* we do not need to handle cases for whether or not some estimator expects a
  `props` argument.

Advantages of a single argument:

* we are able to consider kwargs to `fit` that are not sample-aligned, so that
  we can add further functionality (some that have been proposed:
  `with_warm_start`, `feature_names_in`, `feature_meta`).
* we are able to redefine the default routing of weights etc. without being
  concerned by backwards compatibility.
* we can consider the use of keys that are not limited to strings or valid
  identifiers (and hence are not limited to using ``_`` as a delimiter).

Test case setup
---------------

Case A
~~~~~~

Cross-validate a ``LogisticRegressionCV(cv=GroupKFold(), scoring='accuracy')``
with weighted scoring and weighted fitting.

Case B
~~~~~~

Cross-validate a ``LogisticRegressionCV(cv=GroupKFold(), scoring='accuracy')``
with weighted scoring and unweighted fitting.

Case C
~~~~~~

Extend Case A to apply an unweighted univariate feature selector in a
``Pipeline``.

Case D
~~~~~~

Different weights for scoring and for fitting in Case A.

Case E
~~~~~~

Extend Case A to apply an arbitrary SLEP005 resampler in a pipeline, which
rewrites ``sample_weight`` and ``groups``.

Solutions will import these definitions:

.. literalinclude:: defs.py

Solution 1: Pass everything
---------------------------

This proposal passes all props to all consumers (estimators, splitters,
scorers, etc). The consumer would optionally use props it is familiar with by
name and disregard other props.

We may consider providing syntax for the user to control the interpretation of
incoming props:

* to require that some prop is provided (for an estimator where that prop is
  otherwise optional)
* to disregard some provided prop
* to treat a particular prop key as having a certain meaning (e.g. locally
  interpreting 'scoring_sample_weight' as 'sample_weight').

These constraints would be checked by calling a helper at the consumer.

Issues:

* Error handling: if a key is optional in a consumer, no error will be
  raised for misspelling. An introspection API might change this, allowing a
  user or meta-estimator to check if all keys passed are to be used in at least
  one consumer.
* Forwards compatibility: newly supporting a prop key in a consumer will change
  behaviour. Other than a ChangedBehaviorWarning, I don't see any way around
  this.
* Introspection: not inherently supported. Would need an API like
  ``get_prop_support(names: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Literal["supported", "required", "ignored"]]``.

Possible public syntax:

TODO



Solution 2: Specify routes at call
----------------------------------

Similar to the legacy behavior of fit parameters in
:class:`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`, this requires the user to specify the
path for each "prop" to follow when calling `fit`.  For example, to pass
a prop named 'weights' to a step named 'spam' in a Pipeline, you might use
`my_pipe.fit(X, y, props={'spam__weights': my_weights})`.

SLEP004's syntax to override the common routing scheme falls under this
solution.

Issues:

* This gets tricky or impossible where the available routes change
  mid-fit, such as where a grid search considers estimators with different
  structures.
* This may not work if a meta-estimator were to have the role of changing a
  prop, e.g. a meta-estimator that passes `sample_weights` corresponding to
  balanced classes onto its base estimator.  The meta-estimator would need a
  list of destinations to pass props to.

Possible public syntax:

TODO

Solution 3: Specify routes on metaestimators
--------------------------------------------

Each meta-estimator is given a routing specification which it must follow in
passing only the required parameters to each of its children. In this context,
a GridSearchCV has children including `estimator`, `cv` and (each element of)
`scoring`.

Pull request `#9566 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9566>`__
is a partial implementation of this approach.

Disadvantages:

* Routing may be hard to get one's head around, especially since the prop
  support belongs to the child estimator but the parent is responsible for the
  routing.
* Need to design an API for specifying routings.

Possible public syntax:

TODO

Solution 4: Each child requests
-------------------------------

Here the meta-estimator provides only what its each of its children requests.
The meta-estimator would also need to request, on behalf of its children,
any prop that its descendants require.

Each object in a situation that could receive props would have a method like
`_get_prop_requests()` which would return a list of prop names (or perhaps a
mapping for more sophisticated use-cases). Group* CV splitters would default to
returning `['groups']`, for example.  Estimators supporting weighted fitting
may return `[]` by default, but may have a parameter `request_props` which
may be set to `['weight']` if weight is sought, or perhaps just boolean
parameter `request_weight`. `make_scorer` would have a similar mechanism for
enabling weighted scoring.

Benefits:

* This will not need to affect legacy estimators, since no props will be
  passed.
* This does not require defining a new syntax for routing.
* The implementation changes in meta-estimators may be easy to provide via a
  helper or two (perhaps even `call_with_props(method, target, props)`).
* Easy to reconfigure what props an estimator gets in a grid search.
* Could make use of existing `**fit_params` syntax rather than introducing new
  `props` argument to `fit`.

Disadvantages:

* This will require modifying every estimator that may want props, as well as
  all meta-estimators. We could provide a mixin or similar to add prop-request
  support to a legacy estimator; or `BaseEstimator` could have a
  `set_props_request` method (instead of the `request_props` constructor
  parameter approach) such that all legacy base estimators are
  automatically equipped.
* If the parameter request does not correspond to a `get_params` parameter,
  `clone` will have to ensure that this request is cloned as well as
  parameters.

Possible public syntax:

* `BaseEstimator` will have methods `set_props_request` and `get_props_request`
* `make_scorer` will have a `request_props` parameter to set props required by
  the scorer.
* `get_props_request` will return a dict. It maps the key that the user
  passes to the key that the estimator expects.
* `set_props_request` will accept either such a dict or a sequence `s` to be
  interpreted as the identity mapping for all elements in `s`
  (`{x: x for x in s}`). It will return `self` to enable chaining.
* `Group*` CV splitters will by default request the 'groups' prop, but its
  mapping can be changed with their `set_props_request` method.
