SLEP020: Simplifying Governance Changes
=======================================

:Author: Thomas J Fan
:Status: Accepted

Abstract
--------

This SLEP proposes to permit governance changes through GitHub Pull Requests,
where a vote will also occur in the Pull Request.

Detailed description
--------------------

Currently, scikit-learn's governance document [2]_ requires an enhancement
proposal to make any changes to the governance document. In this SLEP, we
propose simplifying the process by allowing governance changes through GitHub
Pull Requests. Once the authors are happy with the state of the Pull Request,
they can call for a vote on the mailing list. No changes are allowed until the
vote is closed. A Pull Request approval will count as a positive vote, and a
"Request Changes" review will count as a negative vote. The voting period will
remain one month as stated in the current Governance and Decision-Making
Document [2]_.

Discussion
----------

Members of the scikit-learn community have discussed changing the governance
through :ref:`SLEP019 <slep_019>` in following PRs:

1. `enhancement_proposals#74 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/74>`__
   proposed updating the Governance to broaden the notion of contribution in scikit-learn.
   The draft was approved and merged on 2022-11-18.
2. `enhancement_proposals#81 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/81>`__
   proposed updates to :ref:`SLEP019 <slep_019>`.

:ref:`SLEP019 <slep_019>` also includes the voting change proposed in this SLEP.
This SLEP's goal is to simplify the process of making governance changes, thus
enabling the governance structure to evolve more efficiently.
