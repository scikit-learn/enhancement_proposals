Abstract
--------

This SLEP proposes some guidelines for writing and reviewing external contributions
to the scikit-learn blog post.

Detailed description
--------------------

Scikit-learn has a blog post available at the following URL:
https://blog.scikit-learn.org/. Since its origin, the blog post is used to relay
information related to diverse subject such as sprints, interviews of contributors,
collaborations, and technical content.

When it comes to technical content, up to now, the content is only limited to the
scikit-learn library. However, the scikit-learn community is going beyond the
library itself and had developed compatible tools for years. As an example, the
scikit-learn-contrib repository [2]_ is hosting a collection of tools which are not
part of the main library but are still compatible with scikit-learn.

This SLEP proposes to extend the scope of the technical content of the blog post to
accept contributions in link with the scikit-learn ecosystem but not limited to the
scikit-learn library itself. However, it is necessary to define some guidelines to
manage expectations of contributors and readers.

Here, we define the guidelines for external contributions that should be used to
write and review external contributions to the scikit-learn blog post.
